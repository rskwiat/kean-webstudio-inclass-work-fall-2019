# Items Covered

## HTML Tags

Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (`<>`).
```
  <opening> text content </closing>

  <p>Hello World</p>

```

## CSS

CSS is not really a programming language. It is not a markup language either â€” it is a style sheet language. This means that it lets you apply styles selectively to elements in HTML documents.

```
selector { property: value; }

p { color: red; }

```

### Layout Tags

`<div>`

The HTML Content Division element (<div>) is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS.

`<head>`

The Head is the part of an HTML document that contains metadata about that document, such as author, description, and links to CSS or JavaScript files that should be applied to the HTML.


### Basic Typography

`p, blockquote`

`<p>`

Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

### Heading Tags

`h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6`
