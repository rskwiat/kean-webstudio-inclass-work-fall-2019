### SVG 2.0 Spec

*Web users, content authors, and implementers of both browsers and authoring tools all benefit from tight cohesion and interoperability of Web technologies, in terms of functionality and syntax. SVG 2.0 is a backwards-compatible extension and reformulation of SVG 1.1, with key features from SVG Tiny 1.2. SVG 2.0 is intended to work more seamlessly with other Web technologies, such as HTML 5, CSS, DOM, and other core features of the open Web platform. Advanced features of SVG, such as filters, gradients, clipping, and other effects are intended for use with HTML and other presentation languages, as well.*
