      <h3>Seriously, what the fork else do you want?</h3>
      
      <p>You probably build websites and think your shirt is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some forking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherforker. Let me describe your perfect-ash website:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>shirt's lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li>Fits on all your shirty screens</li>
        <li>Looks the same in all your shirty browsers</li>
        <li>The motherforker's accessible to every ashhole that visits your site</li>
        <li>shirt's legible and gets your forking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Well guess what, motherforker:</h3>
      
      <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shirt. It's a motherforking website. Why the fork do you need to animate a forking trendy-ash banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shirt? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your forking site, and some motherforker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shirt. Not to mention blind people will never see that shirt, but they don't see any of your shirty shirt.</p>
      
      <section class="cards">      <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="card">
            <h4>It's forking lightweight</h4>
    
            <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your forking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the forking background color of a main? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shirty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shirt.</p>
          </div>
      
          <div class="card">
            <h4>It's responsive</h4>
    
            <p>You dumbash. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherforking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherforking Tamagotchi.</p>
          </div>
      
          <div class="card">
            <h4>It forking works</h4>
    
            <p>Look at this shirt. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherforker. It makes sense. It has motherforking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ash browser know what the fork's in this forking site. That's semantics, motherforker.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <div class="clearfix"></div>

      <p>It has content on the forking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>

      
      
      <h5>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherforker in IE6. I forking dare you.</h5>
      
      <h4>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h4>
      
      <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no forking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shirty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a forking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's forking beautiful.</p>
      
      <h5>Yes, this is forking satire, you fork</h5>
      
      <p>I'm not actually saying your shirty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are ones we create ourselves. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>

      <p>From the philosophies expressed (poorly) above, txti was created. You should try it today to make your own motherforking websites.</p>
